        It’s funny, walking is one of the basic experiences we are tasked with
        learning in this life and yet as we grow older, we forget how important
        it is to put one foot in front of the other. From infancy, parents worry
        if their child is “on time” with their contemporaries, wondering if
        she’s falling behind because she doesn’t walk at 9, 12, or 18 months.
        One can easily grow up thinking that if she is not like everyone else,
        then she does not fit. It seems so simple, doesn’t it? To put one foot
        in front of the other, taking one step at a time in order to learn how
        to push against what is there to keep you down. That’s how we grow, you
        see. It is with each step, each action that goes against natural forces,
        that brings you to the top of mountain. That’s the only way to see
        breath-taking views. So, go for walk and see what you can accomplish.
